## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- Java 21 for building the Spring Boot service using Maven.
- Bash shell for running the ATM CLI.

## Running the Project

### 1. Build the Wallet Service
Before running the Docker containers, ensure the Wallet Service JAR is built using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```


### 2. Start the Services

Use the following commands to manage the Docker Compose environment:

- To start the services and build the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

- To rebuild containers without using cache:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

- To stop and remove all running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Once the containers are running, the services include:

- **ATM Service**
- **Wallet Service** (Spring Boot application)
- **PostgreSQL Database**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the following containers:

- **ATM Service**
- **Wallet Service** (Spring Boot application)
- **PostgreSQL Database**

### 3. Testing the ATM CLI

After starting the services, execute the ATM CLI from the container:

```bash
docker exec -it atm-service /app/start.sh
```

#### Â Sample Commands:

```bash
$ login bob
Hello, bob!
Your balance is $0

$ deposit 10
Your balance is $10.00

$ logout
Goodbye, bob!

$ login alice
Hello, alice!
Your balance is $0

$ deposit 5
Your balance is $5.00

$ transfer bob 10
Transferred $5.00 to bob
Owed $5.00 to bob
Your balance is $0

$ logout
Goodbye, alice!

$ login bob
Hello, bob!
Owed $5.00 by alice
Your balance is $15.00

$ transfer alice 10
Transferred $10.00 to alice
Owed $5.00 to alice
Your balance is $5.00

$ deposit 10
Your balance is $10.00

$ transfer alice 5
Transferred $5.00 to alice
Owed $5.00 to alice
Your balance is $5.00

$ logout
Goodbye, bob!
```

docker exec -it atm-service cat /app/activity.log
```

Logs for the Wallet Service can be viewed using:

```bash
docker logs wallet-service
```
